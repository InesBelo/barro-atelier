# ba.ro studio 

## Milestone Project 1 [Code Institute]

### Introduction to the Project

> "You have to be in tune with the clay and react to what state it's in to work with with" [John Sheppard]
<br>

This web application, named **bar.ro** studio, is the result of my first milestone project [PP1] for Code Institute. Thinking about the theme for this project, I decided to imagine a fictional pottery studio located in my hometown, that is, in the city of Barreiro, Portugal. The reason behind this choice of mine has to do with the fact that, historically, Barreiro was known for its close link to the pottery craft. Futhermore, nowadays, the municipality is really proud of its cultural and artistic efforts regarding the city. Therefore, it made perfect sense, as I mentioned earlier, to imagine a pottery studio that could reinforce the city's past with its contemporary cultural impetus.  




**bar.ro** studio is a fictional pottery atelier based in the city of Barreiro, Portugal.

# Project Credits

## Content

- [Sedimento](https://sedimento.pt/) - **bar.ro** project was largely inspired by Sedimento studio in terms of content and *website* design choices;
- [Caulino](http://caulinoceramics.com/) - in addition to Sedimento studio, Caulino studio's website was also relevant to set some parts of **bar.ro** project content (namely, the *Courses* section). *Contacts* section was also widely informed by Caulino's.

## Media

- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/pt-br/) - all images used on **bar.ro** were taken from **Pexels**. There is a reason to it, since the pretense was that all the images aesthetically resembled each other as closely as possible as to give the project an all-sense of unity. **Pexels** had some visually pleasent and inciting images regarding pottery making that fit well with the intended aesthetic of the project;

 # Project Acknowledgements
 
**bar.ro** studio, as already stated at the intro, is a fictional pottery atelier. However, if I had chosen other kind of paths in my life, it probably could have been perfectly real as, once, I was utterly passionate about pottery. As years went by, pottery ceased to be part of my life, but I do feel that I need to aknowledge here my former professors from António Arroio Secondary School - **Alberto, Elsa, Fernando, Helena M., Helena P.** and **João** - who taught me every single thing I know about the art of pottery. That knowledge was, of course, channeled to **bar.ro** studio project. 

For sure **[Joana Vieira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vieirajoana/?originalSubdomain=de)**, my best friend, will remember those times at António Arroio when I used to work with clay almost daily. She saw me plenty of times sitted on a potter's wheel, completely focused into my creative process. So, when I told her that I was thinking about studying software development, as she did before, she maybe remembered my old self, whom really did not care about analytical suff. Nonetheless, she happily encouraged me to go ahead - as she always does.

At this point, I would also like to thank my dear friend **[Guilherme Doval](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guilherme-doval/)** for his precious help in the course of this project. His experience in web devolpment and his critical eye were fundamental to come up with practical and consistent solutions in line with my visions for this project. As little as he may believe, his words of encouragement and appreciation are infinitely important to me.

Last - but not the least - I shall thank my mentor, **Chris Quinn**. Chris, thank you for you patience, gentleness and always on-point feedback. I am very grateful for all your commitment and the help you have given me in this project, and I am looking forward to the next ones.
