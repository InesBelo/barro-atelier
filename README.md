 ## Project Acknowledgements
 
**bar.ro** studio, as said before, is a fictional pottery atelier. However, if I had chosen other kind of paths in my life, it probably could have been perfectly real as, once, I was utterly passionate about pottery. As years went by, pottery ceased to be part of my life, but I do feel that I need to aknowledge here my former professors from António Arroio Secondary School - **Alberto, Elsa, Fernando, Helena M., Helena P.** and **João** - who taught me every single thing I know about the art of pottery. That knowledge was, of course, channeled to **bar.ro** studio project. 

For sure **[Joana Vieira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vieirajoana/?originalSubdomain=de)**, my best friend, will remember those times at António Arroio




, my best friend, was instrumental for me to take the plunge into software development studies. Thank you for giving me courage to do this. 

I would also to thank my dear friend **[Guilherme Doval](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guilherme-doval/)** for his precious help in the course of this project. His experience in the web devolpment area and his critical eye were fundamental to come up with practical and consistent solutions in line with my visions for this project. As little as he may believe, his words of encouragement and appreciation are infinitely important to me.

Last, but not the least, 
 
 
 - **Chris Quinn** -  Thank you for your patience and always on-point feedback
